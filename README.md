**Bring your AI coding harness to your team.** Run Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi, or Codex on your machine, share it live in Mattermost or Slack. Colleagues can watch, collaborate, and run their own sessions — all from chat.

## Supported Harnesses

| Harness | Install | Interactive Approval | Plan Approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | ✅ | ✅ |
| OpenCode | `npm i -g opencode-ai` | ✅ | — |
| Pi | `npm i -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` | — | — |
| Codex CLI | `npm i -g @openai/codex` | — (sandbox) | — |

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Slack | ✅ v1 |
| Mattermost | ✅ inherited from fork |
| Discord | Roadmap |
| Teams | Roadmap |

## Quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakejimenez/tandem/main/install.sh | bash
tandem   # runs setup wizard
# In Slack: @tandem fix the auth bug
```

The setup wizard walks through harness selection, platform credentials, and permission mode. The single binary embeds the Bun runtime — no separate Bun install required on target machines.

## Multi-User Channel Mode

Each user who mentions `@tandem` in a channel gets their own private thread. Nobody sees another user's output unless they click into that thread. Sessions are isolated — different users can run different harnesses in the same channel simultaneously.

- `@tandem sessions` — list active sessions (admin only)
- `!admin` prefix — admin-only commands for session management

When capacity is full, incoming requests queue in FIFO order with a configurable timeout rather than being dropped.

## Known Parity Gaps vs claude-threads

- Mattermost support is inherited from the fork but has not been tested end-to-end with the new harness adapters.
- Fleet/Parallel Mode (running multiple harnesses in one session) is roadmap.

## CJIS Posture

Agent output never leaves the machine except to the configured chat platform (Slack or Mattermost). The single binary embeds the Bun runtime, so there is no external runtime dependency to audit.

**Bring Claude Code to your team.** Run Claude Code on your machine, share it live in Mattermost or Slack. Colleagues can watch, collaborate, and run their own sessions—all from chat.

> _Think of it as screen-sharing for AI pair programming, but everyone can type._

## Features

- **Real-time streaming** - Claude's responses stream live to chat
- **Multi-platform** - Connect to multiple Mattermost and Slack workspaces simultaneously
- **Concurrent sessions** - Each thread gets its own Claude session, persisted across bot restarts
- **Collaboration** - `!invite` teammates to participate; they get added as `Co-Authored-By:` trailers on Claude's commits
- **Permission modes** - Three-way control over Claude's tool-use: `default` (every action prompts for 👍/✅/👎 approval via emoji), `auto` (Claude's classifier auto-approves low-risk; high-risk still prompts — recommended), or `bypass` (no prompts, all tools allowed). Set via config, `--permission-mode` CLI flag, or in-session with `!permissions default|auto|bypass`.
- **Claude posts back to chat** - Claude can call `send_file` to drop screenshots, generated PDFs, plots, or audio directly into the thread, and `read_post` to follow a Mattermost or Slack permalink the user shares
- **Git worktrees** - Isolate Claude's changes in a branch with `!worktree feature/foo`; supports `list`, `switch`, `remove`, `cleanup`, `off`
- **File attachments** - Drop images, PDFs, archives, or any file into the chat; Claude reads them from disk via its own `Read`/Bash tools (100 MB cap)
- **Chrome automation** - Optional integration with Claude in Chrome for web tasks
- **Multi-account Claude (opt-in)** - Round-robin sessions across multiple Claude subscriptions or API keys with automatic rate-limit cooldown — see [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#claude-accounts-optional-multi-account-mode)
- **Auto-update** - Bot checks npm for new versions and offers to restart; `!update now` / `!update defer` controls the timing

## Quick Start

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install (pick one)
bun install -g claude-threads   # with Bun (recommended)
npm install -g claude-threads   # with Node

# Run the setup wizard
cd /your/project
claude-threads
```

The **interactive setup wizard** will guide you through everything:

- Configure Claude Code CLI (if needed)
- Set up your Mattermost or Slack bot
- Test credentials and permissions
- Get you up and running in minutes

**Need help with platform setup?** See the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for Mattermost or Slack bot creation.

### Prerequisites

- **Bun 1.2.21+** or **Node 20+** - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Claude Code CLI working** - test with `claude --version` (needs API key or subscription)

### Use

Mention the bot in your chat:

```
@claude help me fix the bug in src/auth.ts
```

## Interactive Controls

**Permission approval** - When Claude wants to execute a tool:

- 👍 Allow this action
- ✅ Allow all future actions
- 👎 Deny

**Plan approval** - When Claude creates a plan:

- 👍 Approve and start
- 👎 Request changes

**Questions** - React with 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣ to answer multiple choice

**Session control** - ⏸️ to interrupt, ❌ or 🛑 to stop, ↩️ to resume a timed-out session

## File Attachments

Drop any file into the chat (image, PDF, archive, source, log, you name it). The bot saves it to a per-thread directory and prepends the path to your message; Claude reads it with its own `Read` tool (full multimodal for images and PDFs) or processes it via Bash. Single 100 MB cap per file. Need to extract a zip? Claude runs `unzip` itself.

Going the other way, Claude can post files back into the thread (screenshots, generated PDFs, plots, MP3s) by calling the `send_file` MCP tool. Path is validated against the session working directory; auto-approved so the user doesn't have to 👍 every screenshot.

## Collaboration

```
!invite @colleague    # Let them participate
!kick @colleague      # Remove access
```

Unauthorized users can request message approval from the session owner with a 👍 reaction.

Invited collaborators are added as `Co-Authored-By:` trailers on any commits Claude makes during the session. Each collaborator runs `!github-email <their-noreply-address>` once (find yours at <https://github.com/settings/emails>) and the bot remembers it across sessions.

## Sharing Links With Claude

Paste a Mattermost or Slack permalink in the thread and Claude can resolve it to the post body (and optional thread context) via the `read_post` MCP tool, instead of asking you to copy-paste. Auto-approved; scoped to channels the bot can already see.

## Git Worktrees

Keep your main branch clean while Claude works on features:

```
@claude on branch feature/add-auth implement user authentication
```

Or mid-session: `!worktree feature/add-auth`

## Access Control

Restrict who can use the bot during setup (or reconfigure later with `claude-threads --setup`).

Leave the allowed users list empty to let anyone in the channel use the bot (be careful!)

- **[Configuration Reference](CLAUDE.md)** - Technical details and architecture

## Updates

```bash
npm install -g claude-threads
```

The bot checks for updates automatically and notifies you when new versions are available.
